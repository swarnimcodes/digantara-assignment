# digantara-assignment

This is a python based microservice developed as part of an assignment for Digantara.
The objective is to develop a job scheduling microservice which is scalable and modular.

The backend has the following features:
- Job Scheduling: Schedule jobs without having to learn a new way of scheduling things. Just use the cron syntax.
  This removes the need to maintain code for custom scheduling and instead relies on tried and tested cron jobs
  making scheduling as customizable as you want.
